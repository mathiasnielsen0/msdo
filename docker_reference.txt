Create a directory on your local machine for this workflow.
$ mkdir self-contained-container && cd self-contained-container
Create a python file that prints "Hello World" and save it as hello_world.py:
# hello_world.py

print('Hello World!')
In the same folder, create a Dockerfile (filename Dockerfile) with the following contents:
# Dockerfile

# Use latest Python runtime as base image
FROM python:3.6.5-alpine3.7

# Set the working directory to /app and copy current dir
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

# Run hello_world.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "hello_world.py"]
We can use docker build -t hello-world . to build an image from a Dockerfile located in the current directory with the tag, hello-world.




docker build -t hello-world .     //Builds an image from current directory
docker run hello-world    //Runs container from image tag hello-world
docker ps -a    //Lists stopped containers
docker run -it hello-world //Runs terminal interactive
docker run -d hello-world //runs terminal detached
