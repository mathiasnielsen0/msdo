SkyCave - Starting point for the SkyCave project
====

*Henrik BÃ¦rbak Christensen, Computer Science, Aarhus University*

Minor but important contributions by thesis student *Daniel Damgaard*,
graduated Summer 2016.

What is it?
-----------

SkyCave is the exam project in the *MicroService and DevOps* fagpakke
at Computer Science, Aarhus University. It is loosely inspired by the
very first adventure game in computing, *Colossal Cave Adventure*, by
Will Crowther, 1972. However, game elements have been removed and
replaced by MMO (Massive Multiuser Online) features.

The code base was originally developed for the course *Cloud
Computing* 2015 - 2016, and later heavily rewritten
during 2019. Security aspects and updating to Gradle 6+ during 2021.

Project lifted to Gradle 8, JUnit 5, and FRDS.Broker 3.0.3 during
2023.

Please consult material on the course homepage for any further
information.

Requirements
------------

To execute and develop SkyCave, you need Java 11+, and Gradle 7+
installed. If you do not have Gradle 7+ installed, then be sure to
*use the gradle wrapper* by initially doing

    gradle wrapper
    
and then make a habbit of `./gradlew xxx` instead of `gradle xxx` in
the examples below.

How do I get started?
---------------------

For running the daemon (SkyCave application server) and the cmd
(SkyCave client/user interface), typical usage is

Starting a SkyCave application server (the *daemon*) using its
configuration file 'http.cpf':

    gradle daemon -Pcpf="http.cpf"

To start the daemon in a specific configuration as required by an
exercise, use a CPF named after the exercise, like e.g.:
  
    gradle daemon -Pcpf="quote-client.cpf"

To shut down the daemon again, do it the hard way: Hit Ctrl-c.

Starting a SkyCave client command-line (the *cmd*) configured to
talk to a daemon in a specific configuration, again, use 
-Pcpf=(exercise.cpf):

    gradle cmd -Pcpf="operations.cpf"

(Note: Most exercises do not need special configurations for the 
'cmd' as the default http.cpf will suffice for almost all cases,
except contacting a real cloud-deployed daemon.)

The *cmd* defaults to the initial (starter code) player with ID =
mikkel_aarskort and password '111'. To log in as a specific player, use

    gradle cmd -Pcpf="http.cpf" -Pid=magnus_aarskort -Ppwd=222
    
The 'TestStubSubscriptionService' only knows three users:

    mikkel_aarskort, 111
    magnus_aarskort, 222
    mathilde_aarskort, 333
    
Configuration of SkyCave
-------------

SkyCave is heavily reconfigurable to allow automated testing, as well
as supporting incremental development work and alternative
implementations of protocols, databases, service connectors, etc. The
configurability is controlled by reading **Chained Property Files
(CPFs)**, like `http.cpf` above, which define properties = (key,value)
pairs for all configuration options. All keys are prefixed by
SKYCAVE_. For instance, the following key-value pair defines which
host and port the *daemon* is operating on (from http.cpf):

    # === Configure for server to run on localhost
    SKYCAVE_APPSERVER = localhost:7777

Following the Gradle convention of having resource files in subfolders
of `src/main/resources`, you should locate your CPF files in the
`resources/cpf` folder. Note that the client (cmd) and server (daemon)
subprojects have their own CPF files; in most cases it is only the
server side that needs a lot of reconfiguration for a specific
exercise.

Review the provided `local.cpf`, `socket.cpf`, and `http.cpf` for
examples. The gradle build scripts define `http.cpf` as the default
for *daemon* and *cmd*.

Both subproject /server and /client (the 'daemon' and 'cmd'
respectively) have their own set of CPF files in the resource folder.

**Note:** A central aspect of CPF files is the *chaining feature* in
which one CPF may inherit and overwrite key-value pairs from an
ancestor CPF file, by the chain line. For instance, the `http.cpf`
inherits most of the properties from `socket.cpf` by using the chaining
line:

    # http.cpf is reusing that most is
    # already set correctly in socket.cpf

    < cpf/socket.cpf

The CPF library can be found
at [Chained Property Files (CPF)](https://bitbucket.org/henrikbaerbak/cpf).

How to I get started understanding the code?
--------------------------------------------

I advice starting by reviewing the testcases for the Player
abstraction.

First review the tests for the `server` project,
test/cloud/cave/server/TestPlayerServant, which gives you an
impression of the server side implementation.

Next, review the (same) tests in the `client` project
(TestPlayerProxy). Here the IPC/networking layer is 'short-circuited'
and all network calls simulated by simple in-JVM method calls.

The distribution aspect (which is central to the course) uses the
Broker pattern described in [Flexible, Reliable, Distributed
Software](leanpub.com/frds), and if you follow the call sequence from
the tests in the testcases in test/cloud/cave/client/TestPlayerProxy
in the `client` subproject, you will trace through many of the central
aspects (marshalling and IPC).

The code base reuses some default implementations in the [FRDS.Broker
library](bitbucket.com/henrikbaerbak/broker). However, importing the
SkyCave project in IntelliJ will also, through gradle, import all the
source code to browse.

And - review the design slides and other documentation from the course
web pages.

How do I pack the daemon into a deployment unit (jar)?
----------------------------------------------------------

The *daemon* can be packaged into a fat jar (that is, a
self-contained jar bundles with all dependencies included.)

The gradle target is *jar*. The jar file is called 'daemon.jar' and
will be located in the server/build/libs folder.

Example: Make the daemon fat jar and next run a daemon using the jar:

    gradle :server:jar
    java -jar server/build/libs/daemon.jar http.cpf

Note that now you have to remember the correct ordering of arguments,
see the main() method of the daemon.

What to do next?

Solve the exercises posted on the e-learning platform using the
techniques taught.

Happy coding. *- Henrik*
