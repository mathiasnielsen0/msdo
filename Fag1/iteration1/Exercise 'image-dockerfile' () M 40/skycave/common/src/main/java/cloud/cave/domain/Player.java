/**
 * The Player role is a the avatar that does the interaction on behalf of the
 * user in the cave.
 * <p>
 * A player is characterized by his/her
 * <ul>
 * <li>'loginName': the name (which MUST be your student ID in the CloudArch
 * course in order to give you your proper score) used to identify the player to
 * the subscription service; typically only used during login.</li>
 * 
 * <li>'playerName': the name by which the player is known in the cave; this is
 * the name that other players see during the cave exploration experience.</li>
 * 
 * <li>'playerID': a unique ID assigned by the subscription system to identify
 * the player; used throughout the code to identify a player but rarely used in
 * the user interface (similar to battle-tags in Blizzard systems.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A player is always associated with specific room in the cave through his/her
 * 'position'.
 * <p>
 * Accessors include methods to view the room that the player is in, see the
 * list of other players in the same room, etc.
 * <p>
 * Some accessors are volatile, that is, two consecutive executions may return
 * different results, as other players may modify the state of the room the
 * player is in.
 * <p>
 * Mutators include methods to move a player in the cave, 'dig' new rooms, and
 * an 'execute' method that may execute command objects installed on the server.
 * The latter allows new behavior to be added at run-time.
 * <p>
 * Class invariants:
 * <p>
 * A player object shall never be instantiated directly but only returned as the
 * result of a successful cave.login().
 * <p>
 * A player object's method shall never be called after the cave.logout()
 * <p>
 * Note: The domain objects of the cave system are Player = the avatar with a
 * specific position in the cave, Cave = the matrix of rooms, and Room = the
 * location with a description, a set of exits, and a list of players currently
 * in this room.
 * <p>
 * However, from the perspective of the player, there is a one-to-one relation
 * to the room which the player is currently in. Therefore the present interface
 * acts as a facade to the room related behavior, i.e.
 * player.getShortRoomDescription() in order to avoid
 * player.getRoom().getShortDescription(). (Which also obeys Law of Demeter / Do
 * not talk to strangers).
