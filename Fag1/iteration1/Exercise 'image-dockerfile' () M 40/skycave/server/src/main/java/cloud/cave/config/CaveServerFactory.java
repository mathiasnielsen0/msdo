/**
 * Abstract factory (FRS, page 217) interface for creating delegates for the
 * server side cave. For production, use the implementation based
 * upon reading Chained Property Files (CPF).
 *
 * The factory creates objects/delegates at two levels:
 *
 * The ExternalService level: All create methods ends in
 * 'create...ServiceConnector()' and these methods creates the
 * connector/driver to some externally running service, like
 * the subscription service, the quote service, the cave storage
 * database, etc. All returned instances implements the
 * ExternalService interface.
 *
 * The internal level: These are more internal to the SkyCave
 * and these objects do NOT implement ExternalService. Examples
 * are the server request handler for the Broker interaction, as
 * well as creator methods for CaveServant and PlayerServant objects.
 * The latter two are NOT relevant for the first course of the
 * fagpakke but comes in handy in the second course.
