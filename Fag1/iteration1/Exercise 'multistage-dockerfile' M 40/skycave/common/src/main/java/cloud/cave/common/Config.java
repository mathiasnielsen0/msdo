/**
 * Config encapsulates the names of CPF file property keys that must be set in
 * order for the factories to create proper delegate configurations of the
 * server and client side of the cave system.
 *
 * A common scheme is applied for ExternalServices, that is, services
 * that run on external nodes in the network, like MongoDB or microservices.
 * These requires A) a DNS address(es) of the server, like 'db:27017' or
 * 'localhost:9999,localhost:9998' and B) a connector implementation in java (akin a
 * driver) for skycave to communicate with it. The latter MUST
 * implement the ExternalService interface. The scheme dictate
 * how CPF files name the two properties. The former must
 * have a suffix of "_SERVER_ADDRESS" and the latter must
 * have a suffix of "_CONNECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION".
 *
 * Example: The CaveStorage implementation must be defined by
 * SKYCAVE_CAVESTORAGE_SERVER_ADDRESS and SKYCAVE_CAVESTORAGE_CONNECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION
 * respectively. See 'socket.cpf' for an example in the resource
 * folder.
