/**
 * Main method for a command line client.
 *
 * It is configured using the base name of the CPF file,
 * which should be located in the proper
 * subfolder named 'cpf/' (Config.CPF_RESOURCE_FOLDER) in resources folder.
 * That is, if started with argument 'http.cpf' then the CPF file
 * in '(project)/src/main/resources/cpf/http.cpf' will be read for
 * configuration properties. You may also provide an absolute
 * path CPF file as argument in which case it will be taken
 * verbatim.
 *
 * 2nd and 3rd parameters are loginName and password
 *
 * 4th parameter is optional, and not really for use in the
 * ordinary use case of Cmd. However, if provided, the
 * argument must be the name of a file whose contents are
 * commands to be executed by Cmd. REMEMBER that the
 * last line MUST be 'q' to terminate the Cmd application.
 * To be used by the automated testing system Crunch.
 *
 * Note: The filesystem is read using File, so this
 * does NOT work if Cmd is bundled into a Jar file.
