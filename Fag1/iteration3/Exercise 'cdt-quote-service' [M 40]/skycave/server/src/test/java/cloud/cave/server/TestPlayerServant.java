/** Test server side implementation of the Player abstraction.
 * 
 * On the server side, a player object directly communicate
 * with the storage layer in order to modify its state.
 * 
 * Most of these tests are the results of TDD. 
 * 
 * Many of the 'later' tests are abstracted into
 * static methods in CommonPlayerTests to allow
 * the same tests to be run using the client side
 * proxies as well to test the Broker handling
 * all method calls correctly.
 *
 * Some methods are tested in separate test classes
 * as they serve as exercises: Quote, Wall, Room handling.
